This is the code for an mobile application named Jeolette! It's basically a cross between Jeopardy! and Roulette that I designed using Flutter and Dart. 

At the start of the game, you will be given $100. You will then be asked to choose between answering a trivia question or taking your chances with the roulette wheel. For whichever choice you pick, you will be asked to bet an amount of money that can't be $0 or higher than the money that your currently have. 

If you choose the trivia question route, you must answer the question right to win the amount of money that you bet. If you get the question correct, you will be redirected to the page where you again get to choose between answering another trivia question or spinning the roulette wheel. If you get the question wrong, then you will be forced to take your chances with the roulette wheel. You will randomly be given an attribute of the roulette wheel (red, black, even, odd) that you will bet the wheel will land on. If it lands on this randomly chosen attribute, you still win the amount of money you previously bet. If it doesn't land on this randomly chosen attribute, you will lose the amount of money you previously bet. You will then go back to the same choice between the trivia question or the roulette wheel.

If you decide to take your chances with the roulette wheel, you will place a bet and choose which attribute (red, black, even, odd) that the wheel will land on. If the wheel lands on your choice, you win the money you bet. If it doesn't, you lose the money you bet.

You can end the game by either getting to $1000 and winning or dropping to $0 and going bankrupt, losing. 

Feel free to suggest any edits as necessary. The ideal version of the game would have an infinite list of trivia questions to keep asking, but I was limited to only 18 in this version. If anybody has any ideas on how to implement this, feel free to suggest them or commit any changes.
